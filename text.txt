agenda: end to end datascience project.
Require for ml end to end project:
1. install anaconda
2. git and github repository
3. project setup
4. requirement.txt

step1. create different environemnet for different project. different projects should be in different folder so that you can create different environment in particular folder to create packages. 


open terminal:
    1. creating a new environment in that folder for all packages.
    creating venv environment in terminal: conda create -p venv python==3.11.5
    2. activating the environemnet:
    in terminal: conda activate venv/
    3. create github repository 
        create README.md file (to write description for the project)
        git init
        to track file:git add README.md
        git status 

        git branch -M main
        git branch
        git remote add origin https://github.com/pushpaneupane710/01_ML_project.git

        refresh github. you sync project to github repository.


        git pull origin main

    4. create file requirements.txt
     in this file you write all packages name
     and can install all written packages by using command in the terminal.

     in terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

     5. setup.py file
     (make entire application a complete package, so this packege you can import)
     we normally make packages of the projects after we finish projects.

    python setup.py install
